1) Arrow function:
this. has the global access, If we want to have only the local access,
we should use the named function: myFunction() { ... }

2) Const:
const hobbies =  ['sport', 'cooking'];
hobbies.push('print');
hobbies' pointer doesn't change, but the content that is pointing has changed.

3) Spread operator:
It is used to copy array. ex. const copiedArray = [...hobbies]; const copiedPerson = {...Person};

4) Rest operator:
const toArray = (...args) {
    return args;
}
example: console.log(toArray(1,2,3))
output: [1, 2, 3];

5) Destructing
const Person = {
    name: "Simon",
    age: "29"
}
const { name } = Person;
console.log(name); // output: Simon
const hobbies = ['sport', 'writing'];
const [hobby1, hobby2] = hobbies;
console.(hobby1, hobby2); // output: sport writing
